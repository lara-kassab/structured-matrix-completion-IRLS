1. Use Test_IRLS to test the IRLS_q code with randomly generated data or
user-input data.

2. Use Test_sIRLS to test the sIRLS_q code for randomly generated data or
user-input data.

3. For Randomly generated data :
   The possible options for problem set-up are given in 'Probinstances.m'.
   You will choose from these options when Test_IRLS or Test_sIRLS is run.
   The problem instances are classified as easy or hard based on
   the # samples available and the degrees of freedom in the matrix.
   
   Some notation used in 'Probinstances.m':
   p: #Measurements or #entries of the matrix that is known. Note p < nxn.
   sr: Sampling ratio = p/(nxn).
   fr: Degrees of freedom ratio.
   

4. For user-input data: 

    Create a input data matrix M.mat which has the following format:
    "The matrix M.mat has 3 columns. The first two columns denote the row-index and column-index.
     The last column has the values of matrix M at the row-column indices specified in the first two columns." 
    The matrix M represents an incomplete matrix that would be completed by the algorithm.
